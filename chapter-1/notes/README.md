## History of the Computer

 - The first computer was made in 1945. It was made by Herman Hollerith it used punch cards for coding.
 - All original computers where 8-bit. Which 8 bits is equal to 1 byte
 - E.B.C.D.I.C. - Extended binary coded decimal info
 - Herman Hollerith founder of Tabulating Machine Company which with three other companies created which is now known as I.B.M.
 - In 1981 the first PC was made.
 - The first PC's used ASCII (American standard code for info interchange)
 - In 1987 clones of I.B.M. came about. For example: Dell and HP.

RISC =  Reduced Instruction Set Computers.

RISC move most frequently used instructions (cache)

ttl = time to leave

## History of Software/Languages
  - 1st generation
    - Machine language or Binary.
    - Uses 1's & 0's.
    - Difficult to find errors.
    - Optimized memory.
  - 2nd generation
    - Assembly language.
    - Writing in mnemonics (short form of a word).
    - Machine dependent not portable.
  - 3rd generation
    - High level language.
    - Too many rules (syntax errors).
    - Easy to understand & find errors.
    - Examples
      - Basic, Pascal, ADA (NASA), Java, C, C++, Python.
  - 4th generation
    - Very high level.
    - Examples
      - Excel, Access, BB, Nomad, AI, Lisp, Prolog, Java Script, Python, C, C++.
    - AI is used in robots, or expert systems.
  - 5th generation
    - Big data, Machine Language.
    - Almost human.
